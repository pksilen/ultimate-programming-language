- Syntax is derived from Python.
  - Curly braces just make code more verbose and are visual clutter compared to single colon
  - Semicolon ending a statement is unnecessary clutter that comes from times when more than one statements
    very put on a single line. This practise is nowadays discouraged in most of the languages and a line should
    contain a single statement only making the ending semicolon unnecessary
